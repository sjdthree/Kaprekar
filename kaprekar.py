 11/6/2019, Kaprekar Numbers are numbers whose square in that base can be split into 2 parts that add up to the original number.

An example: 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 
45Â² = 2025 and 
20 + 25 = 45

45^2

Algebra:

x2 = 1000y+z
x = y+z
where y and z are three digits
and therefore x is at least 3 digits or more

x2 - x = 999y
x: 100 - 1999 -- that is max range if y & z are 3 digits
